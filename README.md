## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-elastic_repo/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.elastic_repo
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-elastic_repo/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
```

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in [`defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-elastic_repo/blob/master/defaults/main.yml):
